# SnappFood_Sentiment_Analysis_with_Traditional_ML_Models
In this repository, we trained various traditional Machine learning methods including SVM and MLP to classify between positive and negative comments in the SnappFood 🍕🍔🍟🌭 dataset. We used both traditional text feature extraction methods (like TF, TF-IDF, Unigram, and Bigram methods) and word embedding methods (like Word2Vec) for processing the text.
